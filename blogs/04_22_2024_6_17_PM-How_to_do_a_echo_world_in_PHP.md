Title: An Absolute Beginnerâ€™s Guide: Creating Your First "Echo World" in PHP

Hello budding PHP enthusiasts! Have you ever wondered how to create your very own PHP "Echo World," similar to the iconic "Hello World" in most programming languages? Fear not, as I'm here to break it down for you, step by step. By the end of this article, you'll have a basic understanding of PHP and the ability to write your first line of PHP code - an "Echo World".

What is PHP?

PHP, standing for Hypertext Preprocessor, is an open-source server-side scripting language typically used for web development. It can be embedded in HTML and is especially useful for making dynamic and interactive web pages. The script executes on the server and the client receives the output as HTML.

Now, let's dive into the process of creating an "Echo World" in PHP!

Setting Up Your Workspace

Before you embark on your coding journey, make sure you have a PHP environment set up. For this, you'll need:

1. A PHP-capable web server: Like Apache or Nginx.

2. PHP software: You can download the latest version from the official PHP website.

3. A code editor: Such as Sublime Text, Atom, or Visual Studio Code.

4. A web browser: Like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari to view the output.

Once you've got your workspace ready, let's move on to the main event - writing your first ever PHP script!

Creating Your "Echo World" in PHP

Step 1: Create a New File

Open your code editor and create a new file. Save it with a .php extension. For instance, you could name your file as "echo_world.php".

Step 2: Start Your PHP Syntax

PHP code always starts and ends with PHP tags. The opening tag is "<?php" and the ending tag is "?>". So, get cracking and type in your opening PHP tag.

Step 3: The Echo Function

Next, add PHP's built-in "echo" function. PHP uses this function to output one or more strings. In your case, the string is "World". Don't forget to wrap "World" in quotation marks (""). 

Step 4: End with a Semicolon

Just like sentences end in full stops, commands (or statements) in PHP wrap up with a semicolon (;).

Step 5: Close Your PHP Syntax

Finish off your PHP syntax by inserting the closing tag (?>). Here is how your complete PHP code should look:

``` php
<?php
echo "World";
?>
```

Running the PHP Script

Save your file and upload it to your web server if you're using one. If not, you can run it directly on your computer via your local server. Open your web browser and type the location of your file in the URL search bar. Once you run the file, you should see "World" displayed on your webpage - and voila! You've just created your first "Echo World" in PHP!

Congratulations! You've taken your first step into the world of PHP and created your "Echo World" script. This might seem simple, but remember, even the longest journey begins with a single step. As you further your PHP education, you'll soon be creating complicated scripts and dynamic web pages. The potential is limitless. Happy learning!
